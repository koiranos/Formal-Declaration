# Formal-Declaration

Greedings!!

This is my first repository and it holds the code for an digital representation of formal declaration sheet from Hellenic Repablic.
It is used by individuals and commercial entities that need to authorize third parties (individuals or businesses) to act in legal affairs instead of them.

The respective HTML, css files are provided.
The link of the coat of arms image that is displayed on the form can be found here: http://www.vagiotis.gr/images/blog/ethnosimo.jpg
